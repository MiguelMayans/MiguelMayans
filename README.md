<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Miguel Mayans</h1>

## About Me

Lover of technology and computing who one day lost his way to college and ended up venturing into the world of gastronomy, my other passion. I pour my heart and soul wherever I go, but fully aware that one does not get far alone. I seek to work on challenging projects with the right team and environment to foster my growth as a professional and as a developer.
