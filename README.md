<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Miguel Mayans</h1>

## About Me

While studying economics, I got lost on my way to university and ended up venturing into the world of gastronomy, one of my great passions. Over the past 10 years as an entrepreneur, I have been part of and led a large team of professionals. Iâ€™ve learned to identify what matters and have adapted to all possible situations. Since I touched a 386 computer at the age of 4 and, after completing a masterâ€™s degree in software development, Iâ€™ve been seeking opportunities to learn and contribute to the technology sector.
